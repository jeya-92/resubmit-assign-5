    <p class="para">Hai, I am P.JEYA LAKSHMI.I am from Tirunelveli.

        everyone which helpful to teamwork.I am a hard-working and driven individual who isn't afraid to face a challenge. I'm passionate about my work and I know how to get the job done. I would describe myself as an open and honest person who doesn't believe in misleading other people and tries to be fair in everything I do.
        I’m very communicative, detail-oriented, and versatile. I like to think of myself as a team player. While I don’t mind taking on solo projects, I prefer to work with others.
        I’ve worked as a systems analyst since I graduated from college. I am very particular about the details of my work, but I also like to stay open-minded to new ideas. I never want to close myself off to other people’s opinions.
        I like to study new things. Being knowledgeable about (your field) or any subject is an ongoing process, and I’m always proactive about seeking new opportunities to develop and grow in my role. Those opportunities could be in the form of training, a conference, listening to a speaker, or taking on a new project, but the motivation is to increase my knowledge of the field.
